Using Internet Explorer's userData behavior to store data on the client
==================

According to the documentation, userData behavior "The userData behavior
persists information across sessions by writing to a UserData store. This
provides a data structure that is more dynamic and has a greater capacity than
cookies. The capacity of the UserData store depends on the security zone of the
domain. The following table shows the maximum amount of UserData storage that is
available for an individual document and also the total available for an entire
domain, based on the security zone.".
